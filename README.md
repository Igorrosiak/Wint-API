# Wint-API
This project was created in 2022 at Senai, and I refactored all the code in 2023/2024 to make it clean and usable.

It consists of a API for a Portfolio Social Network.

This application uses: Java, Spring, Spring Security, Java-JWT, PostgreSQL, JPA and Lombok.

You can use it running "docker-compose up" in the main path terminal AND running the "WintApplication" file.
